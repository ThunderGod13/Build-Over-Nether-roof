If you do this then you will be able to build above
nether roof.

your hight limit of 127 will be increased to 256

the patching way will be very ver easy

but remember, finding the correct binary

was nothing like patching

finding the correct binary was a huge job

Youtuber "Rufus Atticus" helped with that 

patching the game will be very easy since i am giving the correct binary with the file

this project took tons of effort
